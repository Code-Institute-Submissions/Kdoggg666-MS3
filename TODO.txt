KEEP WORKING ON ADD RECIPIE FORM, need to use js to label the newly created input fields. the remove button removes the parent div and so deletes all the new input and labels.

issues:
centering a form input element - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54728464/how-to-center-text-inputs-using-materialize-css
displaying current page as custom text under page heading - fixed by writing a loop to check if the page name and inster an h3 depending on page name. add screenshot. 
label text overlapping on the firs label and not on each new label - figure this out!
werkzuig couldnt build the template for edit_recipe.html - working with michael from CI tutor support we found the problem was a jinja if statement on the base .html - try get this working again. 
Couldnt fetch the name attribute on login - login method only inserted user attribute into cookies so when the user was creating a recipie it was insterting null into created by field. fixed by adding the name field into cookie upon login
Couldnt make the search function work - Tutor support Kevin assisted me in fixing this by adding the propper form action to my search bar as well as using request.args.get("query") instead of request.form.get("query") 



CODE I NEED TO KEEP BUT NOT USE YET!
 <!-- My if statement to check what page you are on and display a custom subheading under the h1 -->
                {% if url_for(request.endpoint) == "/recipies.html" %}
                <h3>Recipies</h3>
                {% elif url_for(request.endpoint) == "/register.html" %}
                <h3>Register a new user</h3>
                {% elif url_for(request.endpoint) == "/login.html" %}
                <h3>Please Log In</h3>
                {% elif url_for(request.endpoint) == "/user_profile.html" %}
                <h3>{{ session['name'] }}'s Profile</h3>
                {% elif url_for(request.endpoint) == "/add_recipe.html" %}
                <h3>Add your own recipe</h3>
                {% else %}
                <h3>No page name set</h3>
                {% endif %}
